# `EDMOSS DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING COURSE 2022`

Welcome to this exicting course where we will be talking about Data science and Machine learning .

This course will be introducing you to the most importance Data sciennce and Machine learning tools as well as how to go about solving real world data science and machine learning project.

The codes and slides use in  this course will be avaliable in this GitHub page.

Happy Learning


## What App are we going to be using to write our codes

We would be writting how codes on jupyter notebook;

### What is juputer notebook?

The Jupyter Notebook App is a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. 
meaning we can write our codes using any of our favorite we browser, its free and open source.

To get juputer notebook ready on our PC, click on the link below to get it installed
